# mcoc_tracker

Welcome to the Unofficial Marvel Contest Of Champions Mobile Video Game Roster Tracker, This gem allows forgetful players like myself an easy way of organizing your roster without searching through the game's interface. Nothing is more annoying than exiting a quest to check your roster and see if you have the correct champion to counteract a difficult node. So use this app to highlight your favortie champs, most wanted champs, or a list of champions you need to upgrade!
As you start this application you will be invited to login or view existing champions in the game! Thank you for using this application and may the rng gods grant you luck on your next crystal opening!
