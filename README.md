# mcoc_tracker

Welcome to the Unofficial Marvel Contest Of Champions Mobile Video Game Roster Tracker, This gem allows forgetful players like myself an easy way of organizing your roster without searching through the game's interface. Nothing is more annoying than exiting a quest to check your roster and see if you have the correct champion to counteract a difficult node. So use this app to highlight your favortie champs, most wanted champs, or a list of champions you need to upgrade!
As you start this application you will be invited to login or view existing champions in the game! Thank you for using this application and may the rng gods grant you luck on your next crystal opening! 

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

gem 'mcoc_tracker'

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install mcoc_tracker

## Usage
Launch the gem file while in the main MCOC_TRACKER Folder and type "./bin/start"

<!-- Follow the username prompt and accept your Pokemon Quest. Type in keywords and numbers to navigate through the pokedex to view a pokemon's stats and description. You will also have the option to add a pokemon to your team. As with most Pokemon games you are allotted 6 spots to fill with any pokemon. If you attempt to exceed this number you will be asked to start over or remove a pokemon from your team. You can view your roster at any time. Once you are finished you are returned a list of the pokemon you selected. Enjoy! -->
