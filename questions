 WHAT TO DO NEXT
 Should I make a user edit, delete route?(good to have in general)(add password confirmation is good, but confirmation means you cant change the password in the same form)

 -Filter out current champions roster from additional roster @rosters.where("Agent Venom")
 -fix edit button so that it does not create completely new champions
 -add new champions in edit form
Change show page to index
