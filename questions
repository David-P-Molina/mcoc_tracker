 WHAT TO DO NEXT
 Should I make a user edit, delete route?(good to have in general)(add password confirmation is good, but confirmation means you cant change the password in the same form)
 need to ensure that the new.erb only shows if they have not made a rosters
 Have the rosters filtered out just need to format and remove logic from view page
 work on edit form

Change show page to index
